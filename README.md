# About
The code provide analysis of Michelson interferention for measurment of phase difference between reflection coefficints of mirror area covered by film and uncovered similar to [1]. 
 
The ```workflow.py``` file presents an example of using processing to determine the phase difference between the indicators of the film reflection (in the middle) and from an uncovered mirror (at the edges). The function for processing is in the ```processing.py``` file
